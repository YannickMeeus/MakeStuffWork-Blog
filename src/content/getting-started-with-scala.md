I have been racking my brain as to how to start learning a new language from
scratch. It's one of the first times I've had to learn a new language on a new
platform for years, and my experience on the .NET stack influences everything I do,
for better or worse.

So I believe the below list best captures what I should be focusing on:

1. Read a configuration value
2. Read and write to a database
3. Expose an API over HTTP
4. Deploy the combination of the all of the above using Docker

This, in my mind, explores a lot of the edges of a language and the eco-system
surrounding it and provides something I can build upon. What it does not do,
however, is expose me to the idioms of Scala. That's next on the agenda.
My priorities, at the moment, are to get a grip on how things hang together
before I dive into Scala's version of the BCL.
