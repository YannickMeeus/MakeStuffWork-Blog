This will probably the third, maybe fourth time I am refreshing and rebuilding this blog. Currently, and for the forseeable future
it'll be Gatsby based, hosted by Now (as provided by Zeit) and written by yours truly.

I will port the couple of posts I've written over the last year or so. If you're coming here expecting tons of Scala
content, you will probably be wildly saddened. I'll be focusing more on C#, TypeScript (and Node.js in general) and cloud offering
comparisons.

If that *does* sound like your cup of tea, then welcome! Stay awhile and listen!
