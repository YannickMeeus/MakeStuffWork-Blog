# Make Stuff Work Online - The bloggening

I've started this blog years ago. It never seemed to survive for long,
usually due to real-life happening (adulting is hard).

This is the fourth iteration, I believe, and it probably the one that
will make it, if only because it's free to host (Gatsby + Zeit Now!).

The blog itself can be found here over at  [https://blog.makestuffwork.online](https://blog.makestuffwork.online).

## Tech Stack

As I've mentioned before, it's built in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/),
on top of [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

Hosting is provided by [Now](https://zeit.co/now), and because the site is all pre-rendered,
the hosting cost is exactly *zero* dubloons.

I use [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), in order to have an active CI pipeline, which is a requirement
for [Greenkeeper](https://greenkeeper.io/) to do it's job. I still publish from my local machine, however.

I usually use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as an editor/IDE.
